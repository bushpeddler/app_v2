1️⃣ Settings Loader Function (Auto-Load Configuration)

To make the project dynamic and scalable, I’ll create a universal settings loader that detects whether config.yaml, config.py, or settings.json is available and loads the correct file automatically.

2️⃣ Integration with main.py

Modify main.py to dynamically load settings:

3️⃣ Expanded Cyberpunk Features

I’ve beefed up the configuration settings to add deep AI, procedural world elements, and immersive physics to fit the cyberpunk/cypherpunk theme.

🔹 New Sections in config.yaml

4️⃣ README Documentation for Settings

To ensure seamless onboarding, I’ve added a dedicated README for the config system.

📂 config_README.md

🚀 Scaling and Future-Proofing

This system allows for:
	•	Easy scalability (Add or remove features dynamically)
	•	Multi-file support (config.yaml, settings.json, config.py)
	•	Automated game settings (Automatically adapts based on config)

### **5️⃣ Next Steps**
- **Would you like me to write testing scripts?** (e.g., unit tests for `settings_loader.py`)
- **Should I integrate the new hacking & AI mechanics into existing modules?**
- **Would you like a UI settings manager?** (To modify settings via an in-game menu)

---

You now have **a fully modular, cyberpunk-ready, scalable configuration system** that can integrate across **all game modules**.
