Here’s a README file (config_README.md) that explains the purpose of the config.yaml file and how to use it.

config_README.md (Game Configuration Guide)

# 🛠️ Arcane Empires Game Configuration Guide

## 📜 Overview
The `config.yaml` file is the **central configuration file** for **Arcane Empires**. It stores essential settings related to **graphics, audio, controls, gameplay, networking, and logging**. Modifying this file allows players and developers to **customize the game experience** without changing the source code.

---

## 📂 File Location
By default, `config.yaml` should be placed in the **root directory** of the game project:

arcane-empires/
├── src/
├── assets/
├── saves/
├── logs/
├── config.yaml   <– This file
└── main.py

---

## 📝 How to Edit
- Open `config.yaml` in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.).
- Modify the values while keeping the **YAML syntax** intact.
- **Do not remove indentation** (YAML is indentation-sensitive).
- Save the file after making changes.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Would you like this in another format?** (`config_README.txt`, JSON-specific guide, etc.)
2. **Want me to integrate a settings loader in `main.py`?** (To automatically apply `config.yaml` settings)
3. **Need any additions?** (e.g., more advanced physics, UI scaling, or mod support settings)
